              <h1><b>Covid History</b></h1>
              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an
                ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory
                syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan,
                China.The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International
                Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 26 August 2020, more than 23.9 million
                cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than
                819,000 deaths; more than 15.5 million people have recovered.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) received
                reports of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[36][37] and an
                investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.[38] On 30 January, the WHO declared the
                outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally,
                affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.</p>
              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale
                Market; the virus is therefore thought to be of zoonotic origin.The virus that caused the outbreak is
                known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin
                coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.The probable
                bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production
                of traditional Chinese medicines.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">The virus is spread primarily via nose and mouth secretions including
                small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually do not travel
                through air over long distances.However, those standing in close proximity may inhale these droplets and
                become infected. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching
                their face.The transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in
                the air for longer periods of time in enclosed spaces.It is most contagious during the first three days
                after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do
                not show symptoms</p>
